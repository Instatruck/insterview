Changelog
============================
Refactored Environment constructor to use declaritive defaults.
Refactored some Exceptions as per Pep 8: No bare exceptions
Note: These are replaced with broad Exception which is a weak warning in PEP8, but
      I'm still new to the codebase so cant anticipate all possible errors
Removed get('key') or 'default' and replaced with get('key','default)
Refactored path join to ose os.path.join for OS agnosticism
Added script to gen docs from docstrings
Defered file int write return to ensure with block cleans up. Generally unnecessary, but
      can potentially be a problem with non standard pythons (jython, etc)
