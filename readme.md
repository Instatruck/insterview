# Instatruck coding test

This is a small coding test to evaluate development skills.

## Goal

The `instatest.py` file contains a class, a mock and some basic tests. The candidate should:

 * Fork the project
 * Read and understand the Wrapper class
 * Using your test framework of choice, write some additional tests, including at least one to ensure that values written to the file cache are re-read correctly
 * Refactor the Wrapper class in any way you see fit, to improve its structure, reliability, testability, maintainability, reusabilty and pythonic-ness.

The aim is to understand your ability and pragmaticness of writing, testing and maintaining python code. The only rules in addition to the above are:

 * executing `python -m instatest` should not fail.
 * any tests should be able to be run with a single command in the root repository folder.

## Delivery

The result should be provided as a GitHub pull request in a manner that identifies you. If you have used additional pip modules, they should be added to the requirements file. If you wish to provide notes, you may do so either in a markdown file or in comments, whichever you feel is more appropriate.
